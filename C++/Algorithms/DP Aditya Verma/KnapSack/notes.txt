Parent Problem = O1 KnapSack.
Get maximum profit from elements of given weights and profits for given limit weight.

KnapSack has following types : 
    1. fractional KnapSack (solved greedily)
    2. 01 KnapSack
    3. unbounded KnapSack

In fractional KnapSack we are allowed to take a fraction of items/ elements.
In 0 1 KnapSack either 0 fraction of whole item is taken or 1 fraction of whole item is taken.
Unbounded KnapSack is extension of 0 1 KnapSack where the items are available in infinite supply.


6 variations of subset sum problems : 
    1. Subset Sum problems
    2. Equal Sum Partition
    3. Count of Subset Sum
    4. Mimimum Subset Sum off
    5. Count of Subset with given Difference
    6. Target Sum (exact same as subset sum just language changed)


Unbounded KnapSack : 
    1. Rod Cutting problems
    2. Coin Change 1
    3. Coin Change 2
    4. maximum ribbon cut.
