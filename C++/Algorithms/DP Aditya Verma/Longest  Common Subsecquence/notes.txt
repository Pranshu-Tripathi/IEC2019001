there are 15 variations that should be known how to solve in this section

    1. Longest Common Subsecquence
    2. Longest Common SubString
    3. Print LCS
    4. Shortest Common SuperSecquence
    5. Min Insert/Delete to convert A to B
    6. Longest Palindromic Subsecquence
    7. Min Insert/Delete to make string a Palindromic
    8. Print SCS
    9. Longest repeating Subsecquence
    10. Subsecquence Pattern Matching (can be solved by two pointers that is a better approach)
